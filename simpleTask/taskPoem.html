		<center><h1><i>A Father To His Son</i></h1></center>
		<h3> - Deepak</h3>
		
		<p class="paraLeft"><b id="one">A father sees his son nearing manhood.<br>
			What shall he tell that son?<br>
			"Life is hard; be steel; be a rock."<br>
			And this might stand him for the storms<br>
			and serve him for humdrume monotony</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="two">and guide him among sudden betrayals<br>
			and tighten him for slack moments.<br>
			"Life is a soft loam; be gentle; go easy."<br>
			And this too might serve him.<br>
			Brutes have been gentled where lashes failed.</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="one">The growth of a frail flower in a path up<br>
			has sometimes shattered and split a rock.<br>			
			A tough will counts. So does desire.<br>
			So does a rich soft wanting.</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="two">Without rich wanting nothing arrives.<br>
			Tell him too much money has killed men<br>
			and left them dead years before burial:<br>
			the quest of lucre beyond a few easy needs<br>
			has twisted good enough men</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="one">sometimes into dry thwarted worms.<br>
			Tell him time as a stuff can be wasted.<br>
			Tell him to be a fool every so often<br>
			and to have no shame over having been a fool</b><br><br></p>
			
			<p class="paraRight"><b id="two">yet learning something out of every folly<br>
			hoping to repeat none of the cheap follies<br>
			thus arriving at intimate understanding<br>
			of a world numbering many fools.<br>
			Tell him to be alone often and get at himself</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="one">and above all tell himself no lies about himself<br>
			whatever the white lies and protective fronts<br>
			he may use against other people.<br>
			Tell him solitude is creative if he is strong</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="two">and the final decisions are made in silent rooms.<br>
			Tell him to be different from other people<br>
			if it comes natural and easy being different.<br>
			Let him have lazy days seeking his deeper motives.<br>
			Let him seek deep for where he is born natural.</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="one">Then he may understand Shakespeare<br>
			and the Wright brothers, Pasteur, Pavlov,<br>
			Michael Faraday and free imaginations<br>
			Bringing changes into a world resenting change.</b><br><br>
			
			<b id="two">He will be lonely enough<br>
			to have time for the work<br>
			he knows as his own.</b></p><br>
